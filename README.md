# üß† LSTM-PPO AI Trading Bot

A deep reinforcement learning bot that uses a custom **LSTM + PPO** (Long Short-Term Memory + Proximal Policy Optimization) agent to simulate and learn profitable trading behavior on historical OHLC price data.
.
This project is designed to run efficiently on **low-memory machines** (like older laptops or Chromebooks). It features a **custom PPO agent** with an LSTM network for temporal learning, allowing it to detect profitable patterns over time.

If you want to use this yourself you should edit api_key and api_secret to your bybit api key and secret, further instructions are below.

It trains on 3 months and data and should be updated every once in a while with Kaggle data, I aim to update it every 3 months, the checkpoint files for testing/live deployment are uploaded here unto GitHub, and are available so you don't need to train the LSTM + PPO bot. The checkpoint and win_rate_knn files will be updated every 2-3 months, so you should run install.sh every now and then (command 'sh install.sh', or just copy-paste the content into your Linux terminal, further instructions are below).

## üìÅ Data Setup

The bot is trained on **1-minute historical OHLCV data aggregated into 15m timeframe**. You can download the data used from the following Kaggle datasets:

| Symbol  | Source |
|---------|--------|
| **XAUUSD (Gold)** | [XAU_1m_data.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/novandraanugrah/xauusd-gold-price-historical-data-2004-2024?utm_source=chatgpt.com&select=XAU_1m_data.csv) |
| **BTCUSD** | [BTC 1m data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imranbukhari/comprehensive-btcusd-1m-data) |
| **BNBUSD** | [BNB 1m data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imranbukhari/comprehensive-bnbusd-1m-data) |
| **ETHUSD** | [ETH 1m data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imranbukhari/comprehensive-ethusd-1m-data) |
| **XRPUSD** | [XRP 1m data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imranbukhari/comprehensive-xrpusd-1m-data) |

If you want to train the bot yourself make sure to place the `.csv` files in the correct folder and edit the `load_last_mb()` and `load_last_mb_xauusd()` file paths in your script to match that path. And set train = True for training in the main function (At the end of the file).

## üß† Agent Details

This bot is based on a **custom LSTM-based PPO agent**, making it suitable for small machines with limited RAM.

- **Inputs**: 19 technical indicators + OHLC-derived features
- **Memory**: LSTM for short/long-term temporal pattern tracking
- **Actions**: Buy, Sell, Hold, or Close
- **Rewards**:  
  - Profit percentage

> ‚ú® Future additions may include a GUI for Android and Windows and ChromeBook.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use (If you find it too difficult to install the program you can copytrade me on ByBit, my username is Naamik)

1. **Install install.sh**
   copy and paste content of install.sh into your linux terminal, whether on Window Subsystem for Linux, Linux, or Linux for ChromeBook.

2. **Create an API key and secret (and Bybit account if not already created, and verify yourself with passport and proof of address)**
   API key and secret creation: https://www.bybit.com/future-activity/en/developer

3. **Paste the API key and secret into line 38 and 39 in lstm-ppo-bot.py**

4. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. **Run training or test**
   ```bash
   cd AI-LSTM-PPO-Crypto-Bybit-Investor; python lstm-ppo-bot.py
   ```
   or if on Android:
   ```
   cd AI-LSTM-PPO-Crypto-Bybit-Investor; python lstm-ppo-bot.py
   ```
8. **Stop program**
   Press Ctrl-C 2-3 times or close the terminal

## üß™ Optional: KNN Reward Filter

A `WinRateKNN` module is included (commented out by default). It filters actions based on expected reward quality using a K-Nearest Neighbor regressor. You can experiment with this for advanced selective behavior based on historical context.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Notes

- This bot **does not require GPUs** and is optimized for low-resource environments.
- All indicators and reward logic are implemented in **pure Python (NumPy, pandas)**.
- Training is **thread-safe** and supports multi-symbol backtesting.
- You can skip training by setting train = False in the main function (at the end of lstm-ppo-bot.py, False by default) if you already trained the bot.
